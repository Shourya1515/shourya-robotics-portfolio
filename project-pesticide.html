    <h1 class="section-title reveal">Pesticide Spraying Robot – Agricultural Field Robot</h1>

    <p class="reveal">
      This robot was developed to help farmers <b>reduce direct contact with harmful pesticides</b>
      during field spraying operations.  
      It is a manually controlled 4-wheel mobile robot equipped with a pumping system and an adjustable
      horizontal & vertical spraying mechanism.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      By allowing farmers to operate the robot remotely, this system increases safety, improves spray
      consistency, and enables more efficient pesticide application in agricultural settings.

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <h3 class="section-title reveal">Project Overview</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      The robot uses <b>four independently powered wheels</b> to move across uneven farm terrain.
      A mounted <b>electric pump system</b> supplies pesticides to the sprayer assembly, which consists of
      PVC pipe branches that allow for both <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical</b> spray coverage.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      The spraying mechanism was engineered to provide a wide and uniform spray pattern while keeping the design lightweight and easy to maintain.  
      The entire system is manually controlled using a handheld RC transmitter, giving the farmer precise directional and spray control.
    </p>
