  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This robot was engineered for high-energy combat scenarios. Its robust frame
    and carefully balanced center of gravity allowed it to survive direct hits from high-RPM spinners.
    The drivetrain and weapon assembly were tuned for torque delivery and rapid engagement,
    and the robot consistently demonstrated reliability throughout the event.
